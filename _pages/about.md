Hi, I am Linda! My Chinese name is Zelin Zhao(赵泽琳). I graduated from New York University (NYU) with majors in psychology and math. During my time at NYU, I worked as a research assistant in the [Winawer Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/winawerlab/), where I focused on linking functionally defined visual maps with underlying anatomical structures and studying the neural basis of visual crowding.

I am now a post-bac research assistant in [Frank Tong’s lab](http://www.psy.vanderbilt.edu/tonglab/web/Home.html) at Vanderbilt University. I am generally interested in exploring the relationship between brain structure, function, and human behavior using psychophysics, fMRI, and computational modeling. Recently, my research interests have centered on developing deep learning networks that meet real-world computational challenges faced by biological visual systems.
